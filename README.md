##Lung Cancer Prediction
Over the years, a steady development associated to health research has been conducted in literature with a view of understanding the best algorithms for disease classification and prediction. Several scientists have applied different kinds of machine learning methods for diseases detection and prediction (Katarya and Meena, 2021; Rahman et al., 2019). For instance, with the advent of new technologies in the field of medicine, huge amounts of cancer data have been collected and are available to the medical research community. However, the accurate prediction of a disease outcome is one of the most interesting and challenging tasks in health research. As a result, Machine machine Learning learning methods have become a popular tool for medical researchers. These techniques can discover and identify patterns and relationships between them, from complex datasets, while they are able to effectively predict future outcomes of a cancer type.
